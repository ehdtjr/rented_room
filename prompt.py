Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.\n\nA logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical operation statements.\n\nA comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:\n- `comp` (eq | ne | gt | gte | lt | lte | contain | like | in | nin): comparator\n- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to\n- `val` (string): is the comparison value\n\nA logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:\n- `op` (and | or | not): logical operator\n- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to\n\nMake sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.\nMake sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.\nMake sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.\nMake sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling date data typed values.\nMake sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.\nMake sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be applied return \"NO_FILTER\" for the filter value.\n\n<< Example 1. >>\nData Source:\n```json\n{\n    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n        \"artist\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"\n        },\n        \"length\": {\n            \"type\": \"integer\",\n            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"\n        },\n        \"genre\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUser Query:\nWhat are songs by Taylor Swift or Katy Perry about teenage romance under 3 minutes long in the dance pop genre\n\nStructured Request:\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"teenager love\",\n    \"filter\": \"and(or(eq(\\\"artist\\\", \\\"Taylor Swift\\\"), eq(\\\"artist\\\", \\\"Katy Perry\\\")), lt(\\\"length\\\", 180), eq(\\\"genre\\\", \\\"pop\\\"))\"\n}\n```\n\n\n<< Example 2. >>\nData Source:\n```json\n{\n    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n        \"artist\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"\n        },\n        \"length\": {\n            \"type\": \"integer\",\n            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"\n        },\n        \"genre\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUser Query:\nWhat are songs that were not published on Spotify\n\nStructured Request:\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": \"\",\n    \"filter\": \"NO_FILTER\"\n}\n```\n\n\n<< Example 3. >>\nData Source:\n```json\n{\n    \"content\": \"Brief summary of a rental room\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n    \"place\": {\n        \"description\": \"The location information of the rental room.
